## Description

Civic Alert Lite is an early warning system app designed to empower communities by providing a reliable platform for disseminating vital information during emergencies and significant events. The app harnesses the power of real-time updates to keep users informed and engaged. With the increasing frequency of natural disasters and civic emergencies, having a tool that allows for quick reporting and dissemination of alerts can be life-saving.

The application aims to bridge the communication gap between local authorities and citizens, ensuring that everyone stays informed and can respond promptly to critical situations. Users can not only report incidents but also monitor alerts from their peers, fostering a sense of community awareness and responsibility.

As a Progressive Web App (PWA), Civic Alert Lite can function offline, allowing users to access information even in areas with limited connectivity. Its user-friendly interface is designed to ensure that users can navigate the app effortlessly, making it accessible for individuals of all ages.

This project reflects a commitment to leveraging technology for social good, aiming to create a safer and more connected community.
